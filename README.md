# Functional Bioinformatics

## Welcome to the Mora Lab

Our main interest is the **functional interpretation** of different types of **omics** data using "**Gene Set Analysis**" (GSA) and **network** methodologies.

Currently, we are working on generating and applying **methods, software tools and pipelines** for the **functional and mechanistic interpretation** of **RNA-seq** (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA) and **ChIP-seq** data, which involve the use of **R** and **graph databases**.

We also have several other plans for the future, which include **personalized** and **dynamic** datasets, **text-mining** and **machine learning** methods, and other exciting topics.
